            click/drag is already claimed by tick-scrubbing, so panning lives
            here instead: drag the thumb (sized/positioned to represent the
            current zoomed window's share of the full date range) to shift
            the view, or click the gutter background to jump the window
            there.

            Visibility is keyed on `hasHiddenRange` (is the full date range
            actually wider than what's currently shown), NOT on `viewWindow`
            being set — those are different things. `viewWindow` is only
            non-null once the user has manually zoomed/panned; the very
            first render already has real hidden content whenever the 2010
            default-view floor (defaultMin, see effectiveMin above) clips off
            an older outlier tick (Google Earth Historical's occasional
            1945-era mark for well-covered cities). Gating on `viewWindow`
            instead left the gutter fully transparent AND pointer-events-none
            in exactly that case — reachable only by first nudging the wheel
            zoom (which sets viewWindow), reading as "there's nothing back
            there" when there actually was. Toggling a source pill off/on
            reproduces this immediately: turning Google Earth back on adds
            its 1945 tick back into fullMin without ever setting viewWindow,
            so the gutter needs to react to that on its own. */}

            above already carry each side's own date/source regardless), so
            the panel is simply shorter by this row's height instead.
            Terrain mode's own "Open in..." launcher is ALSO centered between
            the two captions here, since terrain mode is always forced to
            the 2x1 grid this row needs anyway — a second copy alongside the
            unconditional one in General Settings (general-settings.tsx),
            since this row (and the whole timeline panel it's part of) only
            shows once a historical basemap is actually active and expanded.
            Historical mode keeps its own copy in Compare and Blend
            (comparison-mix-section.tsx), unrelated to this row. */}
