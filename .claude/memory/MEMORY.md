# Project Memory Index

- [Camera sync architecture](camera-sync.md) — PR #10 fixes: elevation as 6th camera param, recalculateZoomAndCenter settle, _elevationFreeze wart, drag-eaten-by-stop, dead ends
- [Docs screenshots context](screenshots-context.md) — Playwright setup/gotchas for capturing real docs screenshots, URL/lightbox conventions, docs-update branch history

- [Phong/Matcap live-layer sharpness](phong-live-sharpness.md) — why live phong reads softer than native hillshade (baked 8-bit normal grid, not the lighting equation), the tile-churn regression to avoid, and the rework options
- [Embed bridge](embed-bridge.md) — meta-app iframe→wrapper state sync: 1 Hz postMessage poll, why not history patching or same-origin DNS tricks, origin allowlist
